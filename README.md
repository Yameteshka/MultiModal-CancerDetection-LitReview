# 🧬 Multi-Modal Cancer Detection – Literature Review

**Bachelor Research Project (Not Peer-Reviewed)**  
Author: Julia Kurnaeva (@Yameteshka), 2025

This repository contains a literature review on how multi-modal data integration (e.g. imaging, genomics, clinical records) impacts the performance of AI/ML models in detecting cancers like lung, breast, pancreatic, and osteosarcoma.

## 📌 Abstract

Traditional AI-based cancer detection models often rely on a **single data modality**, which limits their accuracy. This review investigates **multi-modal integration** — combining different types of biomedical data — and shows how it significantly improves diagnostic performance across various cancer types.

---

## 🔍 Key Contributions

- Overview of **10 recent peer-reviewed studies** (2025) from ScienceDirect
- Comparison of single-modal vs multi-modal models
- Analysis of **bias**, data fusion strategies, and model performance
- Survey of models like **GeneXAI, CAFNet, OmniFuse**, and others

---

## 🧪 Technologies & Methods

- Deep Learning (CNNs, ResNet, Faster R-CNN)
- Fusion Techniques (early/intermediate)
- Data Types: Genomic, Imaging, Clinical
- Search Tools: Zotero, ScienceDirect
